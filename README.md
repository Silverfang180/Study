# Study

Welcome to the **Study** repository! This is a centralized hub for academic resources, personal notes, and curated learning materials. The goal of this project is to maintain a structured environment for mastering new concepts and keeping track of educational progress.



## Repository Structure

The contents are organized logically to make finding information seamless:

* **Subject Folders:** Categorized by academic discipline (e.g., Mathematics, Programming, Physics).
* **Notes & Summaries:** Concise breakdowns of complex topics and lecture highlights.
* **Reference Materials:** A collection of PDFs, useful links, and external documentation.
* **Practice & Labs:** Hands-on exercises, code snippets, and problem sets to test knowledge.



## Getting Started

To explore these materials locally, you can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Silverfang180/Study.git](https://github.com/Silverfang180/Study.git)
